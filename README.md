# Airqualityindexprediction
The project aims to develop a predictive model for the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various regression techniques. The AQI is a critical metric that helps in assessing air quality and its impact on human health and the environment. By creating a predictive model, we can forecast AQI values for specific locations, allowing authorities and individuals to take necessary actions to mitigate air pollution.
